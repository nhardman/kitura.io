	<h1>Command-line tools</h1>
	<p>This article summarizes Swift Server Generator CLI tool commands.</p>
</div>

The generator is an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) module using the [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
library. This means that the generator is a plugin that is executed using the `yo` command-line
front-end to Yeoman. Use the [installation instructions](installation.html) to ensure the
generator and its prerequisites are installed correctly.

> ![info] Note: The generator is also available indirectly using:
>
> * [IBM API Connect toolkit CLI](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMNED_5.0.0/com.ibm.apic.toolkit.doc/capic_swift_overview.html) via `apic swiftserver`  
> (uses v1.0.4 of the generator).
> * [Bluemix CLI Developer Plug-in](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/cloudnative/tutorial_web.html#tutorial/) via `bx dev create`  
> (only supports scaffolded applications).

You can run the generator use the following command:

```bash
yo swiftserver
```

The generator will display a series of prompts asking questions that define what
application will be generated. Once all questions have been answered, the project
directory and files will be written to the filesystem. Then the application will
be built using `swift build`.

## Application generator

**Synopsis**

Creates a new Swift Server Generator application.

    yo swiftserver [options] [name]

**Options**

`-h, --help`

Prints the generator’s options and usage.

`--skip-build`

Generates an application, but does not build it.

`--single-shot`

Disables creation of generator meta-data files (`.yo-rc.json` and `.swiftservergenerator-project`).
Although, this means that you cannot run the generator again on your generated application.

`--init`

Generates a basic scaffolded application with default options into the current directory. The name
parameter is ignored when using this option.

**Interactive prompts**

The generator prompts you for the following information:

-   The name of the application to create, if you have not provided the application name as an argument, as in the following example:

        yo swiftserver bookshop

-   The name of the directory to create the application in; this defaults to the application name you previously entered.

-   The type of project to create; this is a choice between scaffolding a starter project or generating a CRUD application.

-   The pattern type which you would like your application to use; this defaults to Basic, you can also choose Web or Backend for Frontend (BFF).

-   The capabilities which you would like to add to your application; these vary according to your project type. If you select a CRUD application type you can choose any/all or none of the Embedded metrics dashboard, Docker files or Bluemix cloud deployment capabilities. If you select scaffold a starter application you can choose additional capabilities of Static web file serving, OpenAPI/Swagger endpoint and Example endpoints.

-   Select a Data store to use (for a CRUD application); this defaults to memory which is an in-memory data source that is built into Swift Server Generator and is suitable only for development and initial testing. If you want to connect your models to a real data source such as the Cloudant® database server, choose `cloudant` for your back-end data store. The tool prompts you for additional settings and automatically installs the appropriate Cloudant connector package by using the Swift Package Manager. If you want to switch between data stores see the [`config.json file`](config_json.html).

-   Select services (for scaffold a starter application) to generate boilerplate for; these will be Bluemix services if you selected the Bluemix cloud deployment capability, otherwise they will be local services. The available Bluemix services are Cloudant®, Redis, Object Storage, AppID and Auto-scaling; the local services are CouchDB and Redis. The tool prompts you for additional settings and automatically installs the appropriate Swift packages using the Swift Package Manager.

The tool creates the standard Swift Server Generator application structure; for details, see [Swift Server Generator project layout reference](project_layout_reference.html).

After you create an application, you can run additional generators from anywhere inside the application directory:

-   [Model generator](#model-generator)

-   [Property generator](#property-generator)

-   [Refresh generator](#refresh-generator)

-   [Build generator](#build-generator)

---

## Model generator

**Important:** Before running this generator, you must create a CRUD type application by using the [Application generator](#application-generator).

**Synopsis**

Adds a new model to a Swift Server Generator application:

    yo swiftserver:model [options] [name]

**Options**

`-h, --help`

Prints the generator’s options and usage.

**Interactive prompts**

The tool will prompt you for the following information:

-   The name of the model, if you have not provided the model name as an argument

-   The custom plural form of the model name. By default, the tool pluralizes the model name by adding *s*.

    > ![info] All Swift Server Generator models are exposed over REST. A set of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations are therefore available via REST endpoints; for details, see [Exposing Swift Server Generator models over REST](exposing_ssg_models_over_rest.html). Operations on all models use the model’s plural name in the URL; for example, `http://localhost:3000/api/bookshops`.

The tool then invokes the [Property generator](#property-generator) and prompts you to enter model properties.

**Output**

The tool creates a new file that defines the model, /models/model-name.json; for details, see [Model definition JSON file](model_definition_json_file.html). It also modifies the [*OpenAPI (Swagger 2.0) specification*](http://swagger.io/specification/) YAML file that describes and documents the REST APIs. By convention this file is located in the project’s definitions directory; for example, `definitions/appname.yaml`.

---

## Property generator

**Important:** Before running this generator, you must create a CRUD type application by using the [Application generator](#application-generator). Then you must create a model using the [Model generator](#model-generator).

**Synopsis**

Adds a new property to an existing Swift Server Generator model.

    yo swiftserver:property [options]

**Options**

`-h, --help`

Prints the generator’s options and usage.

**Interactive prompts**

The tool will prompt you for the following information:

-   The model to which to add the new property. If there is more than one model defined in the application you will be asked to choose from a list of the available models.

-   The name of the property to add.

-   The data type of the property.

-   Whether the property is required; the default is no.

-   Whether the property has a default value; the default is no.

**Output**

The tool modifies the [Model definition JSON file](model_definition_json_file.html) to add the specified property to the specified model. It also modifies the [*OpenAPI (Swagger 2.0) specification*](http://swagger.io/specification/) YAML file that describes and documents the REST APIs; for example, `definitions/appname.yaml`.

---

## Refresh generator

**Important:** Before running this generator, you must create a Swift Server Generator application by using the [Application generator](#application-generator).

**Synopsis**

Regenerates your Swift Server Generator application.

    yo swiftserver:refresh

**Options**

`-h, --help`

Prints the generator’s options and usage.

**Output**

The tool regenerates your Swift Server Generator application; the files which are updated vary according to the capabilities of your application.  The following application files will not be updated:

-		config.json
-		main.swift
-		Package.swift

---

## Build generator

**Important:** Before running this generator, you must create a Swift Server Generator application by using the [Application generator](#application-generator).

> ![info] In a MacOS environment the build generator will pass additional linker options to the compiler: **-Xlinker -lc++**. for this reason, running **yo swiftserver:build** is preferred over the native **swift build** command.

**Synopsis**

Builds the Swift Server Generator application.

    yo swiftserver:build

**Options**

`-h, --help`

Prints the generator’s options and usage.

**Output**

The tool uses `swift build` to rebuild your Swift Server Generator application.
